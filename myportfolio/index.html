        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p class="manifesto">
          My passion for computer science started when I wrote my first program
          to print "hello world." Today, I'm an aspiring computer scientist
          studying at Portland State University. One project I worked on while
          studying was building a database using SQL to provide a list of
          financial reports, lists of services, lists of providers, and monthly
          reports for clients using Chocan software. This happened over eleven
          weeks using the modified waterfall methodology. Apart from that, I
          work in the IT department for a private food processing company in
          Portland. While working, I have learned and continue to learn about
          Internet protocol, software troubleshooting, server management, and
          more. However, I do see myself working in the fields of cybersecurity
          or artificial intelligence. Although that is what will support me
          financially, I still have a love for music. I plan to continue
          mastering musical instruments to one day have a group of mine and play
          for events as I have already been playing.

        <p>
          The Chocan software was created through the my SQL database that had
          three different terminals: operator, manager, and provider. Each
          terminal had a different functionality and purpose depending on the
          credentials used to login.
